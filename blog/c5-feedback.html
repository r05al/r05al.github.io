      For the past few weeks on our journey to code, DBC has had each student participate in Paired Programming, at least two times a week with each other and an additional time that week, with a DBC grad as a guide. My experience with this part of the curriculum has been very positive. Pairing, utilizing a driver and a navigator, has been very productive. The driver is able to put down their thought process, while the navigator inspects and looks ahead to direct with the bigger picture. I think it has been rewarding in that you are able to actively think out loud and get instant feedback on your thought process and reason though the direction you are taking. By explaining to your partner, you further cement your knowledge on the subject. A good amount of the time, your partner has ideas of their own, and you benefit by learning something new or refreshing existing knowledge. Typically my pairing sessions have had very receptive partners. The only time I think the experience would be difficult was if your pair wasn't as cooperative. Other than that, sessions have been great.

      Prior to reading the feedback, I did feel a bit anxious and wary. But knowing that DBC requests us to use ASK when giving feedback (actionable, specific, kind) I felt more at ease. I did receive very constructive feedback. Looking back, I do tend to try to reach a conclusion before verbalizing. I've worked on speaking my thoughts and bouncing more ideas off my partner in the process. Writing feedback has been fairly easy. I always try to be kind and always provide anything to be constructive. I think the part of being constructive can be difficult at times when your partner is very knowlegable. In the end, I know we can always improve, so I try to make a suggestion along those lines.

      Pair early. Pair often.
