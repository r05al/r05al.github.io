        Have you ever wondered if it would ever be possible to time travel? To be able to go back to and change something that happened in your past that, big or small, would alter who you are today? I feel like there would be too many variables to account for and things could get really messy with the butterfly effect. Fortunately in code, we can go back and fix things, or even go back to fix the fix we thought would make things right. We are able to do so through version control. Version control allows us to keep track of changes to our files over their life and makes collaboration on a project with a team much simpler. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We are able to do this through a few options, the most popular being git. Git has a number of commands and enable you the user to create a master repository and manipulate it with ease. You can start from scratch or clone from an existing repository online. You can create a branch of the master to make your changes, review and finalize, then merge back to the master repository. You are able to check the status of your changes. Keep what you like, and remove what you don't before committing. You are also able to set up a remote connection to push to and pull from the web and keep the two in sync. Git also provides a log of your changes in case down the road you want to go back to a specific version of your file. Git makes this all possible without a fancy time machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        GitHub is the most popular web based git repository. If you are not as familiar with command line interface, GitHub provides a clean and easy graphical user interface. Other than just backing up your files and changes, collaboration is the main reason to utilize their service. Projects can be monitored from start to finish, and revisited over and over from anywhere and by whom you choose to share with. Much of the existing open source code is hosted here and a great resource for all developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Go forth and create without worries! Git will save day as long as you remember to go through the motions to create a new version.
