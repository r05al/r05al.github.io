  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>Overcoming the psych out </h2>
  <h4>August 17, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      The general line of thought is not to perpetuate stereotypes. Thinking that a certain group of people all fall into a certain type of attribute is incorrect most of the time. Unless they specifically belong to a group that advocates and prides itself on a certain behavior, we shouldn't assume that people are a certain way. If you are a strict practicing Catholic and associate with those beliefs for instance, then I can safely say that you acknowledge the Pope as the head of the church. If you just happen to be born into something, but don't necessarily fit into a generalization of your group, then that is unfair. The thing is that when you acknowledge these generalizations of ability they create a subconsious self-handicap or lift on how you perceive your personal ability. The mind is a powerful thing, which has developed for our own survival over the years.

      Stereotype threat is just that. Where your mind is aware of a perceived weakness, ie a stereotype, then it will use cognitive resources for vigilance. This in turn causes the task at hand to suffer vs when you are engaged in a relaxed manner. I assume this is because the mind is diverted to discovering possible outcomes and how that will affect your personal well being, rather than what is in front of you. The more you associate with this group that has this assigned attribute, the stronger the effect of stereotype threat. If you were able to distract the mind from thinking about this, performance would be an accurate reflection on ability.

      Thinking back, I feel like I've experienced it the strongest during high school. To me it's very similar to fixed vs growth mindset, in that it's locked you into a fixed mindset once someone makes you aware of your "disability" to perform at the same level. I wrestled all four years in high school. I had no prior experience, but early in the game I became aware of teammates and of competition that had been competing at a younger age. I didn't feel confident when competing for a spot or going up against one in meets. Further down the line, when I joined varsity, the differences started to melt away and my confidence started to build. My senior year, qualifying for state, I was up against a kid from another school who I acknowledged as "better than me". Looking back, I knew I didn't give it my all. I knew if someone told me "it didn't mean anything" win or lose, I definitely would have taken that match. But it's hard to say that at higher level competition. I think going forward, I need to lay out my concerns, think through each one and see how it will affect my performance.

      Again, the mind is powerful thing, make sure it's on your side.
