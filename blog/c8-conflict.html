    At some point or another, we come across a disagreement with someone else. The way we react to this disagreement can be productive or counterproductive. We can be passive, assertive, positive, or even just down right mean about it. There are several ways a disagreement can play out. But when it comes down to it, we have to look at the context of the situation, down to the basic elements of the problem. From there, the resolution should be relatively simple.

    One particular instance that happened to me personally was when I was sparring during a class at the gym. Typically these sessions are controlled and only go at around 50% power, but in this instance a newer joiner thought he would push his limits. I happened to be paired with him at the start and luckily for me, I'm fairly good at defense and movement. I could tell he was bringing it, feeling the power of glancing blows. After narrowly escaping a few, I would clinch and say "Ease up a bit." but it seemed my words fell upon deaf ears. I think a few rounds in, I got caught with a cleaner punch, so I exchanged a clean flurry of hard combinations back which had the guy doubled over. After that point, maybe due to the brief injury, he eased up. I spoke to him afterwards, and he apologied for going hard and stated he was new to the sparring aspect. I told him not to worry about it, and just focus on technique and defense more than trying to prove something to someone with your power.

    Looking back, I think I could have handled it more peaceably, but in the heat of the moment I figured my resolution would be short and straight to the point. I think in this situation, a situation of natural aggression, it's difficult for both sides to come to terms, unless prior terms had been dictated. Being the newer guy, I assume he let his emotions and instincts take control. Me, being the more experienced guy, should have spoken out more beforehand and in between rounds to set the tone and make reminders.

    In the context of things, generally you want to take a step back and analyze the situation and the players. The situation should be relatively simple, but the players are a bit more complex. People tend to be irrational at times and it may be advisable to communicate what needs to be said, then reconvene after heads have cooled and arguments have been processed. Generally, this will progress the conflict, but it is upon both parties to find a resolution.

    Empathize. Communicate. Resolve.
