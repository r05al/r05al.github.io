  <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
  <h2>Looking into the scope</h2>
  <h4>Aug 17, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
        Scope basically is about what is viewable or accessible where in each of your programs. There are three types of variables; global, class and local. There are also constants, which aren't variables, because they don't change, hence constant. Knowing where you are and what is accessible will help you determine which scope you need to assign your variables to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Global scope covers the entire program. It is created and referenced using the <code>$</code> as the first character. You can reference them at any point in your code and the code will know what it is. It is never out of scope. Benefits are you can use them across classes, but they are typically used infrequently. In object-oriented programming, this info should be siloed into each object rather than available to all. You would need to message that object to get what it has. Assigning global variables would be poor design. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Similar to global variables are constants. Constants are created and referenced using a capitalized name or in all caps. You can refer to certain constants in certain classes and or modules. Constants are like globals, only you need to know the path to get to them for your code to be able to use them in case they are nested. You can refer to original constants if you have created newer instances using double colon. See below:
        <pre>
        #If Array was redefined, to reference original Array constant
        ::Array.new(5,"new")

        #If constant COINS was nested in module CoinPurse, inside class Pocket, inside class Hoodie
        Hoodie::Pocket::CoinPurse::COINS
        </pre>
    <p>
        When you create classes, you are able to create class variables. These begin with two at signs <code>@@</code>. These are not soley class scoped. They are class hierarchy scoped. This means, if you have assigned a particular variable in a parent class, then reassign it in a child of a child, calling it in the parent class will result in the assignment value from down the line in the descendant. Class variables are helpful for talking with several instances of a class and its parents or children. To prevent reassigning, most people create class instance variables, which start with a single at sign <code>@</code>. This is only viewable to that particular instance of that class that you have created. This keeps the variables with and only with the object. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Last but not least is the local variable with the local scope. These are ones that are created on the spot and can be returned to other objects if need be. There are local scopes in the top level, in classes or modules, and in every method definition. They only exist in that particular local scope. The key here is to be able to identify when one ends and another beings. Local variables are the key to OOP and good design. They help ensure objects only know what they need to and pass it along as needed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Be sure to id what scope you are in and make sure it's the one you need when you create your variables!
