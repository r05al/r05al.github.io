  <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>

      There is an open letter that a number of influential AI and robitics researchers have signed to put a ban on AI warfare. In the coming years autonomous weapons, as they suggest will be the next revolution in warfare. Not specifically pointed to AI that becomes self aware, but more so on the automation of taking out the "enemy". The enemy in this case would be targets that meet the criteria programed into these machines. They would be set out on their own to execute that programming without questioning the logic.

      I feel that technology is a very powerful tool that continuously grows and as such it will become weaponized when one feels threatened. In this case it speaks to actual physical harm rather than say hacking information. I think the problem in this case is that in the creation of this type of technology, we lose the conciousness of the decisions being made. There aren't many fail-safes to fall back on when they are used and I would think there would be a lack of transparency in the decision making of the logic. There are many layers to this topic which I haven't covered such as conventions, responsibilities, externalities, etc. I think the point that I'm trying to get to is that as technology moves us to uncharted territories, we should make a conscious effort to be aware of the power we are wielding. We should always take steps to ensure we are utilizing it for the betterment of humanity and not to injury it in any way.
