  <h1>Thinking Style and Learning</h1>
  <h2>I think therefore I learn</h2>
  <h4>July 27, 2015</h4>

       There are various <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Styles</a>(<-click here to see more). Mine in particular is Abstract Sequential. What this means is I analyze before deciding, using logic to find the solution. I learn best when I have solid references to fact check, am in a stimulating environment, but it is difficult working in a small time frame, in repetition, with specific rules, and trying to express my emotions, per the defintion. Through this process, I think the most difficult part is that I feel contrained to learn large amounts of material in a relatively small amount of time. I think from what I can gather, we aren't supposed to learn all the fine details, but work on breath. I get that, but I'd like to achieve mastery with all the pieces, which is part of Abstract Sequential. I think to overcome this, I will need to allocate more of my free time to collecting the pieces I feel I need to create the solid argument that "I am developer professionally". I'll create to do lists that ingrain my coding abilities, like learning all the pieces, reading/contributing to open source projects, learning new librarys, reworking code with different restrictions, etc.

      The I feel I apply my thinking style is in a growth mindset for the most part. The most interesting thing I got from Carol Dweck's work is that you aren't one or the other as a person. You apply one vs the other in different aspects of your life. You can learn to do a lot of things, and so you can be fixed in one thing you learn where you can be growth in the other. I feel like I am growth in the area of learning new ideas and concepts, where I am fixed in learning to be more social. Again, I can definitely and feel motivated to learn programming languages and how different parts of the stack talk through examples, readings, reviewing code, writing/revising code, but socially I feel less inclined to, which falls into the fixed catagory. This brings me back to the video from week 2 on critical inner voice. I think to get out of this fixed mindset I'll definitely have to work on how to manage my inner voice and learn to master it and overcome. I feel like we are all here to become part of a strong community and I definitely want to give back in any way possible, so I'll definitely work on this.
