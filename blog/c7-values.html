    <p>
      In general, I try to live up to personal development. I chose this value because, in the grand scheme of things, all we really have are the bodies we are born in and the lives that we lead. Personal development to me, means, idenifying who we think we are and pursuing who we want to be. Who we are, is the culmination of our actions/reactions in the world around us. Idenifying the point on the map of our life of where we currently are, and seeing where we want to be. What happens when we get there? We can either change that point, or be satisfied. Along the way, we encounter others on their journeys and the interaction leads to different results. Factors push and pull constantly, that we must reevaluate where we think we are as well as the path that we are on.

      More recently a friend of mine asked my advice on relationships. I never thought too much about them, but I realized they weigh heavily on personal development. Your partner in life, I feel, must understand and accept how you work, not necessarily agree with it 100% of the time. I would assume they share the same core values as you, and as such push to strengthen those values in a synergistic way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In regards to combating stereotype threat with my values, I think self evaluation is effective. You are able to take a step back from the situation and truly identify your strengths and weaknesses. If it truly is a weakness, it is your choice to change that. But the first step is admitting it and the hardest part is working on it. If you aren't performing at your true level, acknowledge that and try to delve into why. I would think understanding the irrationality of the issue would help going forward.

      Take time to reflect and meditate.
