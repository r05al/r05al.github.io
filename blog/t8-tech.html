  <h1>Big O Notation</h1>
  <h2>The worst case scenario</h2>
  <h4>Aug 31, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
    When creating a program we try to refactor to remove redundancy and for better programming design. To this point, we haven't looked into the speed and space factor. Generally we just want to make sure it runs, does what we intended, without any bugs or unwanted externalities. But after that point, then what? As we learn to create more labor intensive applications, we must keep these factors in mind. This is where Big O notation and analysis comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
    Big O notation basically looks at your program and its inputs to determine how complex it is to get to its desired output. Let's take a look at some examples.
    </p>
    <pre>
    function bigO1(arr) {
      console.log(arr);
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
    Above is the simplest, where the complexity is O(1). This program, although it take a collection as an input, only has one step, to print the array.
    </p>
    <pre>
    function bigOn(arr) {
      for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        console.log(arr[i]);
      }
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
    When we take it to the next level, and iterate through the collection the complexity becomes O(N), N being the number of steps, which in this case depends on the number of elements in the array.
    </p>
    <pre>
    function bigOnSquared(arr) {
      for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
          for (var j=0; j < arr.length; j++)
          console.log(arr[i] + arr[j]);
      }
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
    As you can see, we can iterate then iterate within that iteration. This is where you can start to see how complex a program can become. In this case the complexity is O(N^2) because it runs N squared times to complete. From here you can see we can nest more and more causing the complexity to grow to N cubed, to the fourth, fifth and so on. This causes your program to take more time and resources to run. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Big O looks at the most complex step. So if you had code that equated to O(N^2) + O(N^4), the focus lies on O(N^4), because as your N grows toward infinity, the O(N^2) grows significantly less that O(N^4). The smaller terms become constants when your data grows. So it is that when examining your code, you must identify where the most step intensive parts are and equate it to its Big O relative to speak to its terms of complexity.
    </p> 
    <p>
    For a more indepth understanding, <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">here</a> is good place to start. Good programming is a good balance of time and space. Understanding Big O is a good start.
