  <h1>Question!</h1>

    <p>
    When we get lost we typically try to find what we are looking for by using the resources we have available to us. If it were location, initially we look around to get our bearings, identify any structures, landmarks or signs, and start from there. In today's world, we use applications that have access to map data and our location provided by cell towers to put us on our way. To set a destination we can be as vague or precise as we want, with searching "coffee" or by entering the street address, city, state, and zip code. The app should be able to provide robust results, if properly maintained. But what if it weren't a place we were looking for, but an answer to a question. These type of queries tend to be very ad hoc depending on the specificity of the context. With that, we need to ask properly in order to yield proper results. Let's think about that.
    </p>
    <p>
    When we have a question that needs to be answered, it generally is a trade of, as most things are, of quality to time. If you have something thats needs answering rather quickly, you shouldn't expect the best results unless you are asking very general questions. Common encycopedic knowledge is easily accessible. Search engines are able to direct you to solid sources of info on the web. When you want to apply that knowledge to a certain situtation and require feedback, it may take time to get it. It depends on two main things, how you ask and the audience you are asking.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first major thing is how you ask your question. If you are able to convey the context of your question and how it applies to the concept you are asking about clearly to your audience, you have done your part. Part of this is looking at similar questions asked on the same subject and reviewing responses. Where were there holes in the original question? What follow up information was needed? When you gather this and still are unsure, now you should be able to post your question in a clearer picture to your answering audience.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second and very important part to getting your answer is to whom you ask. So with that examine the places where you could ask. Look for places where credible and reliable sources lurk. Identify active places, where a response and follow up feedback should come rather quickly. In those places, locate appropriate subcatagories to which your question falls into. Once posted, sit back and work on other things.
    </p>
    <p>
    So finally, when you do get a response, or responses, piece them together to make sense of your question at hand. Was it what you were looking for? If not, take the feedback and rephrase the question to pose what the original was lacking. Gather what you now have, and start the process again. Generally, getting the answer will lead to more questions and this is how we learn.

    <p>
    Particulars. Specifics. Context. These will help people help you and hopefully with this new found knowledge you will do the same!
