  <h1>Like Riding A Bike</h1>
  <h2>What if you weren't taught right?</h2>

    <p>
       Riding a bike is pretty easy after the fact you've already overcome your fear and started pedalling. Having been through the first week of Phase 0 I feel like this type of learning is not the same that I am used to, it's something more. Coming to DBC the culture is definitely something new and different. It's very progressive and pushes one to question their own way of doing things. I feel like I have been forced to reevaluate my thinking process and my work habits, which is a great thing, to know there are so many options to choose from. DBC definitely pushes you to explore yourself and gives you the tools to grow. This type of environment is exciting. Initially, from reading the handbook, the work in Phase 0 is quoted to be 15-20 hours a week, but I feel like I want to spend more time exploring and playing with the concepts in each challenge. My expectations for Phase 0 have changed in that although it's can be something done on the side while working, I don't mind putting in the extra time to get that much more out of the material. My only anxiety are some of these rabbit holes that we come across. How can I differentiate what is necessary to learn now vs. something not as relevant but related that can be learned later? At the end of the day I know the support system is there, and feel confident that I'll be able to take the training wheels off by the end of this program.
