  <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
  <h2>Declassified</h2>
  <h4>Aug 10, 2015</h4>

    <p>
        Ruby allows programmers to create related objects that allow shared behavior through the use of classes. With classes we are able to create a shared collection of methods. Methods defined in the class are made to be accessible to all instances of the class. These are called instance methods. We can use these methods to assign values to variables of these particular instances. These are called instance variables. They always start with an @ (at sign), are only visible to that class, and able to be called in any of the class's methods. Here is a quick example where we create the class Dog, pass in the name and breed to the <code>initialize</code> method. Initialize is executed when you send the message <code>new</code> to the class you have created. 
    </p>
    <pre>

      class Dog
        def initialize(name, breed)
          @name = name
          @breed = breed
        end
      end

      fido = Dog.new("fido", "Terrier")
    </pre>
    <p>
        Typically we don't want to rename our dog, but let's say he's a new pup we have adopted. Since he's a pup he's age 0.
    </p>
    <pre>
       class Dog
        attr_reader :name 

        def initialize(name, breed)
          @name = name
          @breed = breed
        end

        def breed
          @breed
        end

        def new_name(name)
          @name = name
        end


        def age=(years)
          @age = years
        end
      end     

      fido = Dog.new("Fido", "Terrier")
      fido.new_name("Rex")
      fido.age=(0)

      p fido.name
      p fido.breed
    </pre>
    <p>
        Here are a few new additions. We added <code>attr_reader :name</code>. This allows us to call Fido, ahem, Rex by using method <code>name</code>. This is called object attribute reader, a getter method. We are able to read the instance variable <code>@name</code> through this. We can also write through an attribute writer. We defined the setter method for age incorporating the equals sign. Doing so, in order to call this method we must mirror that using <code>fido.age=(0)</code>. This sets the age, hence setter. We can also rewrite this setter method to <code>attr_writer :age</code>. It enables writing to the instance variable <code>@age</code> but not reading. Meaning, we cannot get the age by calling <code>fido.age</code>. If we used <code>attr_accessor :age</code> THEN we could read and write the age of our dog.

        Create your own classes, add your own methods and assign your own variables!
