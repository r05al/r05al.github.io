    <p>
    We started blogging 8 weeks ago as a way to review and reflect on what we had learned over that week's challenges. For me it helped organize the theme and lessons for that week as well as close it out. As we move on to the onsite portion, I think I'll be recording more in a journal. From that, I think I'll be transfering it into my blog, more to reflect on my journey, and how things we gain along the way are incorporated into that. 
    </p>
    <p>
    One really cool think I would want to utlize is jQuery. We touched upon it this week, but its possibilities are like CSS, endless. Since you can manipulate CSS with it, it stretches even farther than CSS. I think since it interacts with the DOM with the user, it will be key to improving my UX for my site.     
    </p>
    <p>
    In regards to my site, I want to keep a simple aesthetic that is very clean. I don't really want to clutter it with too much distraction. I want to try to store links into a popup that show more links to minimize button space. I also want to incorporate simple but very cool effects that work seemlessly with my page.
    <p>
    I know there is still much to learn that I can apply to my site, but I feel confident. The base that I have from these 9 weeks feels like a solid stepping stone. I'm hoping the onsite will continue to guide us through the development universe to better solidify where I want to build and grow from.
